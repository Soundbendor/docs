# Soundbendor Lab
Our lab works at the intersection of music and machine learning. We focus on building a computational understanding of music and sound using state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Working across computational musicology, bioacoustics, emotion recognition, acoustic analysis, and non-speech audio understanding, we engage in deeply interdisciplinary, cutting-edge research in A.I. and data science. 

# About this Wiki
This wiki serves as a living document for lab members to document technical processes, research workflows, model troubleshooting and other information which may be of use to the lab.

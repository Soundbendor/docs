# Introduction
This is resource of advice and common mistake made when writing academic papers for the lab.

# General advice
* use the [Oxford comma](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/)
* avoid abbreviations
  - e.g., *vs.* for versus
* understand semicolon (;) versus colon (:)
  - semicolons connect independent clauses
  - semicolons separate lists (when list items already contain commas)
  - colons introduce a list or an explanation (dependent clause)
* avoid superlatives
  - it is usually subjective and someone, somewhere will object
* avoid parenthetical asides (whether using parentheses or commas)
  - unless clarifying a term definition 
  - parenthesis interrupt flow

# Capitalization
* *[western](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/western) vs. [Western](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Western)*
  - *western* refers to the direction; *Western* refers to culture, countries, and politics

# Punctuation
* *i.e.* (*id est*, "that is")
  - clarifies a point and is not followed by a comma
* *e.g.,* (*exempli gratia*, "for example")
  - is a list and is followed by a comma
* *et al.* (*et alia*, "and others")
  - requires the period after *al.*

# Hyphenization
* *large-scale* vs *large scale*
  - *large-scale* is an adjective
  - *large scale* is noun with adjective modifying it

# Verbs
* use action verbs
* avoid weak/simple verbs
  - e.g., *show*, *feel*, *do*, *go*, *use*
  - limit use of *to be* and *to have*
* avoid passive voice
  
# Words and Phrases to Avoid
* do not use contractions in formal writing
* do not use *due to*
  - save that weather forecasting
* limit use of *where*
  - and only when referring to a location
  - you probably when *preposition + which*, e.g., *in which*, *from which*, etc.
  - note: *where* is used often and incorrectly in convesational speech
* avoid cliches
  - e.g., *in a nutshell*, *throughout history*, *going forward*, *it is well-known*, *on the other hand*
* avoid casual words
  - e.g., *really*, *okay*, *maybe*
* avoid informal words
  - e.g., *a bit*, *a lot*, *til*, *sort of*
* use *significant* correctly
  - do not use unless you have a statistical p-value of a t-test to report

# Citations
* limit direct reference to authors
  - unless the authors or the work is particularly well-known
* organization citations when citing multiple papers at once
  - place in order by year: oldest to newest
  - when the same year, alphabetize 

# Figures
* Axes of subfigure should be on the same scale
  - unless there is compelling reason otherwise (e.g., different metrics)
  - it is misleading to present graphs on different scales (for the same metric)

# Proof-reading Advice
* print out your paper to edit
  - you will find errors and problems you did not see on the screen
* proof-read in a different location
  - step away from your normal writing location and proof-read in a new or different place
* read your paper aloud
  - listen to the rhythm of your sentences and adjust to improve
  - if your paper sounds good aloud, it will read well too
